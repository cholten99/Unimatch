This is Richard's fork of the main UniMatch website.

Stuff I'm intending to try:
- Getting rid of all the distance / location stuff -CHECK
- Integrating the geoxml3 library into our main code (somehow!) -CHECK
- Doing all colours client-side -CHECK
- Changing the exchange format to JSON or XML (i.e. Something quick!) -CHECK
- Loading the stuff in the 'bubble' after loading all the points onto the map -CHECK
- Any pipe-lining...

And then the stuff that works well can be integrated back into the main version...


Client <-> Server Interaction
A New Model

placesinjson.php returns all the data about all the universities that match the query except
matching courses.

getcourses.php takes a mandatory university_code argument as well as other arguments and
returns the list of valid courses

getcourses.php is called on the top 3 results as soon as the client recives them from
placesinjson.php, and on subsequent results whenever they are clicked on (or maybe hover...)
