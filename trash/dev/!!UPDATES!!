I have created a new table in the database called guardian_combo_complete. 
This is the same as guardian_combo, but with 46 previously missing universities added.
The data comes from the original Guardian Google Docs spreadsheet, which were removed before because there was no lat-long data for them in msh100's database.
I have added in the lat-long data from the UCAS map <http://www.ucas.com/students/choosingcourses/choosinguni/map/>.
As such, the information available for these universities are those supplied by The Guardian and the lat-long data.
No information from msh100's database is available (fields are left as NULL).

placesfromdb.php now uses the new database and map.js now uses placesfromdb.php, so additional universities appear on the main page.
You can also call placesfromdb.php using 'placesfromdb.php?display=all' to show information for all universities in the guardian_combo_complete table sorted by institution.
This is how all the universities are displayed on the main page.

Because the table is missing data for the added universities, they will not appear in 'search mode'.
In other words, <placesfromdb.php?group=&min-tut=0&max-tut=9000&min-staff=0&max-staff=30&min-car=0&max-car=100&teach=0&feedback=0&overall=0&min-club=0&max-club=200&min-pub=0&max-pub=1000> will not show the added universities.
The table guardian_combo_complete should either be updated or placesfromdb.php should be able to handle NULL data.
I'm more inclined to go for the latter.
