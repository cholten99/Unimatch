Ok, so it's about 9:30 PM now, but I've found & fixed that bug that was stopping all the pins from appearing. 
So now I can die/sleep happy.

I traced it down to one single non-printing character in places.php. An enter in fact. It read:

echo("
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
<kml xmlns='http://www.opengis.net/kml/2.2'>");

When it should have read:

echo("<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
<kml xmlns='http://www.opengis.net/kml/2.2'>");

Apparently that change breaks all the markers... nice...
And I only found it by chance because I was grumpy enough to get rid of it by habit...

Let that be a lesson to us all.
